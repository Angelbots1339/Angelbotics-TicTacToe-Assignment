# Angelbotics TicTacToe Lesson
## About
This is an unfinished game of TicTacToe to help learn Java.
Make a copy, then finish the abstract methods in FinishedBoard.java (setBoard, isMovelegal, and checkWin).
Message me for help with solutions.
Good luck!

## GameBoard.java
GameBoard.java is am abstract class for you to finish in your own copy. There are several member objects you will need to use:
- `boolean player1Turn`: A boolean, used to indicate which player's turn it is(True if player 1, false if player 2). This will update automatically once a player makes a move
- `int[][] board`: A two dimensional integer array containing the current board. Access at position x and y by using `board[x][y]`.
